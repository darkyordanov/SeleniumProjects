# SimpleSeleniumProjects✅

**Repository Description**
This repository contains Selenium automation scripts designed to interact with various web pages, such as Google searches and the Cookie Clicker game. Each script uses Python and Selenium WebDriver to automate browser tasks like handling cookie consent pop-ups, performing searches, and interacting with webpage elements.

### google_search_automation.py
Description:
This script opens Google, accepts the cookie consent pop-up, and allows the user to input a search query through the terminal. It then searches for the query and clicks on the first search result. The script includes error handling and a delay to let the user view the results before closing the browser.

### interactive_google_search.py
Description:
This script also automates Google searches, but it provides more interaction. After accepting the cookie consent pop-up, it prompts the user to input a search query and proceeds to click on the first search result. The script includes custom print functions to format the output, making it easier to follow along with each action.

### cookie_clicker_bot.py
Description:
This script automates the online game “Cookie Clicker.” It navigates to the Cookie Clicker website, accepts the cookie consent pop-up, selects the English language, and continuously clicks the cookie to gather points. It also checks for available upgrades or products and purchases them if enough cookies are collected. The bot runs in an infinite loop, simulating constant gameplay.
